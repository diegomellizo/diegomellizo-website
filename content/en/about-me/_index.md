My name is Diego Mellizo, a game developer from Colombia.
I studied *Ingenier√≠a de Sistemas* (similar to Software Engineering) at *Universidad de Cundinamarca*, there I developed my first video game as [degree project](/degree-project/).

After graduating, I had the opportunity to have my first experiences creating or modifying a few enterprise web applications with PHP.
Posteriorly, and for several years, I worked developing video games and applications for web browsers, mobile devices and PC, this using either Unity or web technologies, mainly PHP for applications and Phaser.js for games.
Later I decided to start working independently and focus on game development, I am currently using Unreal Engine while working on my next project.

I am always looking for new challenges and learning new and better ways of doing things.
I also love sharing knowledge and experiences, and not just video games but any other form of art.
My hobbies include playing video games, riding a bike, hiking and listening to rock and metal music. ~~By the way, I am also a wannabe singer.~~

So if you want to know more about what I do or just chat, feel free to [contact me](/contact-me/).
