{{< figure src="/shared-l10n/about-me/images/photo.png" >}}

Hí! I'm Diego Mellizo, a game developer from Colombia.
I love using software and technology to create awesome things.
My focus is in developing video games containing high-quality code, with a consistent creative vision, and of course, fun!

I studied *Ingeniería de Sistemas* (similar to Software Engineering) at *Universidad de Cundinamarca*, there I developed my first video game as [degree project](/personal-projects/degree-project/).

After graduating, I had the opportunity to have my first experiences creating or modifying a few enterprise web applications with PHP.
Posteriorly, and for several years, I worked developing video games and applications for web browsers, mobile devices and PC, this using either Unity or web technologies, mainly PHP for applications and Phaser.js for games.
To see my work related to video games you can see my [professional projects](/professional-projects/).

Later I decided to start working independently and focus on game development.
[My first solo project](/personal-projects/tank-blast-arena-2d/) is a demo with multiplayer support made in Unity, which you can play now from your PC's web browser.
Currently, I'm using Unreal Engine while working on my next project.

I'm always looking for new challenges and learning new and better ways of doing things.
I also love sharing knowledge and experiences, and not just video games but any other form of art.
My hobbies include playing video games, riding a bike, hiking and listening to rock and metal music; by the way, I'm also a wannabe singer.

So if you want to know more about what I do or just chat, feel free to [contact me](/contact-me/).
