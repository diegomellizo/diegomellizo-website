My name is Diego Mellizo, a game developer from Colombia.
I studied Ingenier√≠a de Sistemas, an analogous to Computer Science, at Universidad de Cundinamarca, there I was able to develop my first game as my [grading project](/grading-project/).

After graduating, I had the opportunity to get my first experiences working on a pair of web apps in PHP.
After that, and for several years I worked developing games and apps for the web, mobile devices and PC using Unity or web technologies involving JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
Later I decided to start working independently and focus on game development, and I'm currently using Unreal Engine as I work on my next project.

I'm always eager about putting my hands on a new challenge and learning new and better ways to do things.
I also love sharing knowledge and development experiences with others.

So, if you want to know more or just chat, feel free to [contact me](/contact-me/).
